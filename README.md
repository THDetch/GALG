 
### GALG 

the source code is my implementation of an existing game called GALG. This project was associated with my programming-2 course professor Andreas Berl at Deggendorf Institute of Technology as an admission for the exam.
 
To the original Game-> [GALG -Youtube ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2iaoOMT6UQ&t=484s&ab_channel=NenrikiGamingChannel)   
  
To try my own simple game download the file "GALG.jar" and enjoy playing.

### the UML diagram for the whole project to take a quick look how it is organized:

## NOTICE: all GUIs are made with a helper class named "GameView" created by the professor, as GUI was not the main topic at the course.
